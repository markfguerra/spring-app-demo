# spring-app-demo

A Spring app which is intended as a code sample\demo. I've only just started, so I'll be adding more stuff as I go along.

Here is what it does so far:

- Creates a Spring context and a few beans.
- Annotation driven Spring bean configuration. Minimal XML.
- Displays a JSP to the user as a landing page.
- Spring Beans are accessible by the JSP, JUnit tests, and a main() method.
- Calls a RESTful web service from the Server side (RestTemplate class).
- Builds using Maven.
- Runs successfully in Glassfish.
